# Project : German Traffic sign recognition 

## Traffic Sign Classifier

Welcome to the Traffic Sign Classifier project! This project focuses on building a classifier capable of identifying various traffic signs using machine learning techniques. The classifier has been trained on the "German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark" dataset.

### About the Project

This project serves as a elementary exploration into image classification using machine learning. The classifier is trained to recognize different types of traffic signs commonly encountered on roads. Using the dataset provided by the "German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark," the model learns to distinguish between various signs with high accuracy.

### Libraries Used

To develop and train the Traffic Sign Classifier, the following libraries were utilized:

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Pillow (PIL)
- Keras
